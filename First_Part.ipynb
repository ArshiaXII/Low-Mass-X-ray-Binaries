    "\n",
    "Binary stars are of immense importance to astronomers as they allow the masses of stars to be determined. A binary system is simply one in which two stars orbit around a common centre of mass, that is they are gravitationally bound to each other. Actually most stars are in binary systems. Perhaps up to 85% of stars are in binary systems with some in triple or even higher-multiple systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, stars in binary systems have completelty different life evolution from ones that are single, since stars in binary systems can revolutionize life sequences of one another. Therefore, the study of life sequence of binary systems is of paramount interest to scientists, because their life evolutions are influenced on many factors and parameters.\n",

    "\n",
    "A low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) is a neutron star or a black hole orbiting around a stellar companion from which it accretes matter. The accretion process deposits both energy and angular momentum onto the neutron star. The energy is radiated away as X-rays, while the angular momentum spins the star up. In a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), an intense stellar wind from the mass donor may be a consequence of the absorption of X-rays from the mass-accreting neutron star or black hole, and such a wind could change the evolution of these binaries dramatically compared with the evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs), which are close binaries in which the accretor is a white dwarf. \n",

    "Roche-lobe overflow occurs in a binary system when a star fills its Roche-lobe (often by expanding during the later stages of stellar evolution). Models show that in systems such as this, any material that passes beyond the Roche-lobe of the star will flow onto the binary companion, often by way of an accretion disk.

    "\n",
    "sometimes this mass transfer resulting from Roche Lobe is unstable because it is occurring at an extremely high rate. In these cases, the overflowing mass builds up so much that is overflows the companions roche lobe as well and engulfs the entire system. This is what we refer to as a common envelope (CE).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Common-envelope evolution (CEE) is the name given to a short-lived phase in the life of a binary star during which two stars orbit inside a single, shared envelope. CEE is believed to be a vital process in the evolution of a large number and wide diversity of binary stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physics of CE evolution is poorly understood. This is because proper modelling of the CE phase requires time consuming 3-dimensional simulations. While efforts are being made in this regard, it is still not feasible to simulate the entire evolution of CE systems. Therefore, it is common to discuss CE evolution in terms of the energy budget of the system. An efficiency parameter, α, is used to characterize the fraction of available orbital energy:\n",
